# General resources

There are a ton of books and online resources available to help you master data structures and algorithms!  Here are a few to get you started:

- LeetCode (https://leetcode.com) - More problems targeted for those seeking positions in FAANG and big companies
- HackerRank (https://www.hackerrank.com/) - More beginner-friendly problems
- Pramp (https://www.pramp.com/) - Interview question and coding question practice
- CodeWars (https://www.codewars.com/) - Additional problems created by users; not as rigorously tested
- "Introduction to Algorithms" - a book by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein, probably the best one out there
- VisuAlgo (https://visualgo.net/en) - Visualizations of tons of algorithms and data structures
- GeeksforGeeks (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) - Tons of resources on programming; be careful as it's not as thorough or always peer-reviewed
