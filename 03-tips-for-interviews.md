# Tips for interviews

When you are interviewed for a job, you will want to do your best to stand out from all the others that have applied in terms of technical skills, communication skills, attitude, and more.  This page is meant to give you some tips to help you prepare for the interview.  Some tips will be more applicable to more specific roles, and there is no single one-size-fits-all approach that fits for everyone.  So I will attempt to cover as much as I can for the most common types of roles.  **NOTE:** This does *not* cover preparing your resume (make sure your resume is tailored to the job description as best as you can and build projects applicable to the role, for instance) or networking or negotiating with an offer, all of which are very important.  This is only meant for the interview portion.

There are four main parts that you'll want to be comfortable with in general:
- Fundamentals of computer programming and the skills applicable to the tech stack
- Coding while under time pressure and stress
- System design and tradeoffs
- Behavioral skills and general fit into the company

## Phases of the interview
DISCLAIMER: The actual phases will vary widely by company and role.  These are general phases of the interview.

### Phone (or live online) interview
This phase is meant for the interview to gauge your background, talk about your projects and answer some basic questions about your skills.  Come with solid proof - and not just a sense of hope - that you can do the job, so talk about what you've done and the measures of success, e.g. closed 1000 sales.  Use this as an opportunity to show *genuine* enthusiasm for the role, and explain why you're an excellent fit for the company and the role.  Align yourself as best as you can to the role.  You often will be asked to talk about your long-term plans, so be prepared!

### Technical assessments
You will more than likely have at least one round of technical assessments to determine how well your knowledge and skills line up with the role.  Most of the time you will be given a series of challenges to solve within a time limit.  These problems are meant to assess how well you write efficient, clean, and correct code - and how well you can explain your logic.  Be prepared to talk about why you took one approach over another - or even solve it multiple ways.  Time and space complexity is important as well, as your code should be as efficient as possible, and there will likely be trade-offs, so make sure you can explain what they are!  Lower-level roles will be a bit more lenient when it comes to finding an optimal solution, but higher-level roles will be stricter.

**Be warned that you often will have to write your code on a whiteboard, so don't assume that you will have the luxury of looking stuff up or debugging with a computer!**  Communication is important here, so if you have questions about the problem itself or about problem constraints, please ask!!  Coding is a two-way street.

For mid- and senior-level roles usually, you will often have a system design assessment.  Be prepared to draw out each component of the system and talk about each step.  Be ready to go into each part in detail and talk about concepts like load balancing, caching, database sharding/replication, microservices vs. monoliths, message queues, and more.  Walk through each step, talking about tradeoffs as you weigh memory and time constraints.  Scalability is very important!!

Some interviews will have a take-home assessment, where usually you will have to build a project or solve a series of more complicated challenges within a time limit.  There's debate on the best approach to assessing a person's skills, so be ready no matter the approach used!

### Behavioral interview
You will be asked what makes you a great fit for the role, and you will often talk to higher-ups in the company, along with project managers and senior engineers, and recruiters if you haven't spoken to them already.  This is where you will most likely have to use the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) method to talk about past experiences and hypothetical scenarios and how you have or could handle them.  Also be ready to talk about situations where you failed or things didn't go as planned; what lessons did you learn, and how did you apply them?

**IMPORTANT:** After each phase of the interview, make sure you thank everyone involved!  This usually involves sending a thank-you message or card, so make sure it's genuine.  I recommend talking about a point that was brought up that excited you, e.g. a project that was discussed, future prospects for the company.

## Preparing for the interview
Do NOT let *imposter syndrome* get to you - remember why you're applying to the role you want!  You can do this!

**Months beforehand:** Ideally you should have accumulated a lot of knowledge on the tech stack and getting very familiar with each technology utilized.  A superficial level of knowledge will not be sufficient; make sure you understand the important concepts and more advanced ones!  Make sure you have a language or two picked out for the technical assessment(s), and start solving problems in them.  

If you're not comfortable with the basics of the language(s) you'll use, this is a great opportunity to bring yourself up to speed with the syntax and the important functions/methods and general design.

For algorithm challenges, make sure you have a solid grasp of useful data structures and techniques, which this series of tutorials covers.

**A few weeks (or more ideally) beforehand:** Make sure you practice your problem-solving and system design skills!  Tackle at least 2-3 problems a day from sites like LeetCode, HackerRank, CodeWars and more.  

If you have a rubber duck or a similar inanimate object you can talk to, it'll come in handy because you can use the item to help you prepare for the interview in that you can talk about how you solved the problem.  If you can grab a real-life interview partner or at least talk to someone else who can assess your communication skills.  This is a great chance to help you with behavioral questions by utilizing the STAR method.  

If you haven't researched the company, this is a great opportunity to do so.  Get as familiar with it as you can, and try to reach out to folks who are already there to get a feel for a typical day at the company.

If your interview is virtual, take some time to get familiar with the platform(s) that will be used (e.g. Zoom, CoderPad).

**The day before:** Make sure you get a good night's rest, and do NOT cram!!  Cramming is not an effective way to learn and retain knowledge!!  Review any concepts where you might be rusty, and make sure you know the company and its values!  Make sure you have a list of questions prepared so you can ask them in the interview; remember that communication is a two-way street!

**The day of the interview:** 
- Have a healthy breakfast the morning of the interview!  You don't want to fight drowsiness or hunger while in the interview; you need all the energy you can muster.  
- Be flexible and be a good teammate!  If an interviewer wants you to solve a problem in a specific way or wants more clarification, please heed them!
- Ask questions early and often, especially in the technical assessment and at the end of the interview!  
- Talk it out: engagement is crucial!  Don't stay silent!  Explain each step of your solution, and talk about future optimizations.
- Come with the right attitude!  Do NOT convey a sense of desperation under any circumstances.  Bring your enthusiasm and a willingness to learn!
- Be humble, but also prepare to brag.  This sounds contradictory, but be sure to hype your achievements and act humble when you work with others and talk about situations that didn't go so well.
- In algorithm challenges and system design assessments:
  - Ask for clarification and ask about constraints to the problem.  This will help you determine edge cases.
  - Talk about tradeoffs!  Why did you pick this approach over another?  What constraints are you dealing with?
  - Make sure you tackle edge cases and scenarios that could cause your function/method or app to fail.
  - Test early and often!  Walk through each step!
- Don't be vague!  Explain yourself.  Demonstrate your knowledge and projects, and be prepared to talk in depth!

**Afterward:**
- Request feedback, if possible.
- Assess what went well and what didn't go well.
- Send thank-you notes or cards!

Relax and remember: you got this!

## General tips
### Front-end/full-stack developer roles
Here are some tips to keep in mind for front-end development:
- Be comfortable with HTML and CSS!
- How do you optimize performance (i.e. minimize load times)?
- If you're using a specific front-end framework - how deep is your knowledge of it and of DOM manipulation in general?

### Back-end/full-stack developer roles
Be prepared to talk about everything that a back-end developer entails, including, but not limited to:
- Database design and schemas
- RESTful APIs and other APIs in general
- Testing, including unit testing
